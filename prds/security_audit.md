# Security Audit Checklist for B2C Application

This checklist focuses on securing the application against common web vulnerabilities relevant to a B2C context, aiming for robust protection without excessive complexity.

**1. Access Control & Authentication:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints (especially login, password reset, signup) to prevent brute-force and DoS attacks.
  - *Assessment: Likely Gap. No general API rate limiting found (middleware/server level). Only a specific manual time-check in `ArtifactService.ts`.*
  - *Resolution: Implemented API rate limiting in middleware-api.ts with:*
    - *Path-specific limits (stricter for auth, moderate for data modification)*
    - *IP-based limiting for unauthenticated requests*
    - *User-based limiting for authenticated requests*
    - *Proper 429 responses with standard headers (Retry-After, X-RateLimit-*)*
    - *Note: In-memory implementation needs Redis/distributed store in multi-instance production environments*
- **CAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms on all public-facing forms, particularly authentication (login, signup, password reset) and high-value actions.
  - *Assessment: Likely Gap. No CAPTCHA implementation found on auth forms (`AuthUI.tsx`).*
- **Authentication:** Ensure all sensitive API endpoints require proper authentication. Verify user status (e.g., paid/active) where necessary.
  - *Assessment: Appears Adequate. Next.js middleware protects routes, API routes check auth (Bearer/cookie), Supabase handles core auth. User status check needs specific verification if required.*
- **Password Policy:** Enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity). Offer Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an option.
  - *Assessment: Likely Handled by Supabase. Password policy/MFA options are configured in Supabase settings. Email OTP is implemented.*
- **Session Management:** Use secure, HttpOnly cookies for session tokens. Implement reasonable session timeouts and secure session invalidation (logout).
  - *Assessment: Appears Adequate (via Supabase defaults). Supabase client libraries handle session cookies, typically using secure defaults (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax). Logout implemented.*
- **Secure Password Reset:** Ensure the password reset mechanism is secure (e.g., time-limited tokens sent via email, not guessable).
  - *Assessment: Potential Gap / Needs Verification. Standard password reset flow (`resetPasswordForEmail`) not found in initial scan. Need to confirm if it exists or if only OTP is used. Supabase default reset is secure if used.*

**2. Authorization & Data Access:**
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Utilize RLS in the database wherever applicable to ensure users can only access their own data or data they are explicitly permitted to see.
- **Endpoint Authorization:** Double-check authorization logic on the server-side for all actions. Prevent Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) by verifying user permissions for requested resources.

**3. Input & Output Handling:**
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize *all* user-provided input (query parameters, request bodies, headers) on the server-side to prevent Injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Output Encoding:** Properly encode output displayed in the UI to prevent reflected or stored XSS.

**4. Data Protection:**
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Enforce HTTPS sitewide (HSTS header recommended).
- **Sensitive Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., PII, certain user content) at rest in the database.
- **Minimize Data Storage:** Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.

**5. API & Secrets Management:**
- **API Key Protection:** Ensure API keys (especially for third-party services) are *never* exposed in client-side code (frontend JavaScript). All interactions requiring secret keys must happen via backend API routes/serverless functions where keys are securely accessed (e.g., via environment variables or secrets management). Avoid committing secrets to version control.
- **AI Usage Caps:** Implement usage limits/caps for any AI features to prevent resource exhaustion or unexpected costs.

**6. Infrastructure & Dependencies:**
- **WAF Configuration:** If using a hosting provider like Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare, enable and configure their Web Application Firewall (WAF), including features like Attack Challenge Mode or Bot Fight Mode.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan application dependencies (frontend and backend) for known vulnerabilities and update promptly.
- **Security Headers:** Implement essential security headers:
    - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) - Start with a basic policy and tighten over time.
    - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
    - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
    - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or `no-referrer`

**7. Error Handling & Logging:**
- **Generic Error Messages:** Avoid leaking sensitive information (stack traces, database errors, internal paths) in error messages shown to users.
- **Security Logging:** Implement logging for key security events (logins, failed logins, password resets, permission changes), but ensure logs do not contain sensitive data like passwords or full credit card numbers.

**8. Protection Against Specific Attacks:**
- **CSRF Protection:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) initiated via web forms or JavaScript.
